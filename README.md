 Features
- Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices together (if dimensions are compatible).

- Matrix Addition: Add two matrices of the same dimensions.

- Matrix Subtraction: Subtract one matrix from another (same dimensions).

- Matrix Transposition: Flip a matrix along its diagonal.

- Determinants: Calculate the determinant of square matrices.

- Matrix Inversion: Compute the inverse of a matrix (if invertible).
